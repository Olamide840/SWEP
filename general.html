        <h2>What is Cybersecurity Awareness?</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity awareness means knowing about the cyber threats that exist and how to defend against them. It includes understanding how attackers work, what mistakes to avoid, and how to apply safe practices when using technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Awareness is often the first line of defense. Educated users are less likely to fall victim to scams and breaches.

            Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It is also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cyber threats have become more common in our daily lives — from phishing emails to stolen passwords. Understanding the basics of cybersecurity helps protect yourself and your digital environment from harm.

          <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
          <p>There are many different kinds of cyber threats, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Tricking people into giving away personal information via fake emails or websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software such as viruses, worms, or spyware designed to damage systems or steal information.</li>
            <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malware that encrypts data and demands payment for release.</li>
            <li><strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Threats from people inside your organization or personal space who misuse access.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Best Practices for Staying Safe Online</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use strong and unique passwords for different accounts.</li>
            <li>Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking suspicious links or downloading unknown files.</li>
            <li>Keep your operating system and software updated.</li>
            <li>Don't share personal information on unsecured websites or public Wi-Fi.</li>

          <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>
          <p>
            In today's digital world, almost everything we do — from banking to social media — involves the internet. Without good cybersecurity, you risk losing sensitive data, being hacked, or having your identity stolen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations, governments, schools, and individuals must all take responsibility for staying cyber aware and safe.
